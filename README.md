# Small Crypto Exchange

## Description

This project implements a small crypto exchange, designed using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). The core component of this implementation is the `Database` class, which serves as the backbone for managing the exchange's data.

## Features

- **Database Class:** The `Database` class encapsulates the functionality required to store and manipulate data in the crypto exchange. It provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database.

- **ERD Design:** The exchange's database schema was carefully designed using an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) approach. This design ensures efficient data storage and retrieval while maintaining data integrity.

- **Crypto Trading:** The exchange enables users to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies. The `Database` class handles the storage and processing of trade orders, account balances, transaction history, and other related information.
